Intel Core i3-14100 Desktop Processor 4 cores (4 P-cores + 0 E-cores) up to 4.7 GHz,Brian A,Fast and runs cool. Very good graphics for CPU. Can game as long as you pair it with discrete GPU.
Intel Core i3-14100 Desktop Processor 4 cores (4 P-cores + 0 E-cores) up to 4.7 GHz,Hau Le,"Upgrading from i5 6600. My new i3 is so cute im going to nickname it AWESOME! The cooler is very elegant. I hope it works! Thanks! Amazon for fast shipping arriving a day early and packaged nice!I was really excited about the cooler but the mounting mechanism is aweful. It dont clip dont nice now matter how hard i tried. Theres always one last clip just loose. I can reach on the backside and pop it off easily with my finger. I can understand people on a budget and needs to rely on this cooler and intel provides, Thanks! but i switched over to a cheap waterblock and i felt way more at ease.Intel skimped on the thermal paste. upon first installation i tried a game and it throttled my cpu with turbo boost on. I took the cooler off to try another cooler and looked at the paste it barely cover the cpu.I added more paste on top of intel paste and got a 15c drop and no more throttle. If you dont have better cooling solution i advise you get more thermal paste for sure.I test CPU on game COD MW3 before with intel 6600 i get 35-50fps with a lot of micro stutter.now with new intel i3 its getting 80-120fps smooth. and the fps counter saying its only using about 10-15 % cpu activity! im very happy. Thanks!

It doesn't complain about anything, although it is very hot, yes. But with good liquid cooling, which is already quite good, it is controlled. I liked it a lot, without detracting from the AMD competition that is doing great too. But in my case, since DDR5 memories are optimized for Intel and I don't want to be struggling, I decided on this one and I don't regret my purchase. Very good product of premium quality."

Intel Core I9-14900K LGA 1700 New Gaming Desktop Processor 24 Cores (8 P-Cores + 16 E-Cores) with Integrated Graphics - Unlocked,Mergatroid,"I was using a 10700K. I decided it was time..well, actually I got the itch.I decided to go with the 14700K for a few reasons. One is that it's the only 14th gen part from Intel that got a significant upgrade (four more e-cores and 8 more threads, plus a small clock boost).I also don't like that the 3DFX part from AMD had caused some minor issues for people, and I definitely don't like the RAM issues I see all the time on AMD systems. If it wasn't for the RAM issues, I may have gone AMD this time. Out of all the Intel systems I have assembled for customers over the years, I have not once come across a RAM issue that wasn't caused by bad RAM.This CPU is working perfectly, and gaming excellently. Gaming benchmarks show it to be a very good CPU, and I am not having any issues with it.If you are interested in any other Intel parts, I suggest going with 13th gen as you will basically get the same part for less money. For an i7 system though, this is an excellent CPU and a half decent upgrade over the previous gen.

IntelÂ® Coreâ„¢ i9-14900KS Desktop Processor 24 cores (8 P-cores + 16 E-cores),DUBNASTY,"The Intel® Core™ i9-14900KS Desktop Processor arrives with much anticipation, boasting impressive specifications on paper. However, a closer examination reveals that this processor falls short of delivering the expected value for its price tag.

At first glance, the i9-14900KS appears promising, with its high clock speeds and purported performance enhancements. However, when put to the test, it becomes evident that the marginal improvements over its predecessors do not justify the hefty price premium attached to it.

One of the major drawbacks of the i9-14900KS is its lackluster performance gains in real-world scenarios. Despite the incremental upgrades in clock speeds and architecture, users may find that the difference in performance compared to previous generations is negligible in most tasks, from gaming to content creation.

Moreover, the i9-14900KS faces stiff competition from rival processors, such as those from AMD's Ryzen lineup, which offer comparable performance at a more reasonable price point. In terms of value for money, the i9-14900KS simply does not measure up, as consumers can find better alternatives that provide similar or even superior performance without breaking the bank.

Furthermore, the i9-14900KS's power consumption and thermal management remain areas of concern. Despite being marketed as a high-performance processor, it tends to run hot under heavy workloads, requiring robust cooling solutions to prevent thermal throttling and maintain stable operation.

In conclusion, while the Intel® Core™ i9-14900KS Desktop Processor may appeal to enthusiasts seeking the latest and greatest hardware, its lack of significant performance improvements and unfavorable price-to-performance ratio makes it a hard sell for the average consumer. With more cost-effective options available on the market, investing in the i9-14900KS may not be the wisest decision for those looking to maximize their computing power without breaking the bank.

IntelÂ® Coreâ„¢ i9-14900KS Desktop Processor 24 cores (8 P-cores + 16 E-cores),Mirko,"I took this upgrade, excited by the I9 14900KF series. In games, it surpasses the Ryzen 7900x3d in many scenarios, trailing only slightly behind the 7950x3d in terms of FPS. Contrary to what I read online, this processor does not overheat despite the extra GHz compared to the KF version. Unlocked to 6.2 GHz with a max temperature in-game around 54°C, obviously depending on the scenarios in Cyberpunk 2077, Horizon Zero Dawn, and Starfield. All in 2K ultra or crazy ray tracing, path tracing, and DLSS when activated

In game supera in tanti scenari il ryzen 7900x3d restando dietro per pochi fps al 7950x3d. Processore che non scalda minimamente come leggo in giro nonostante i ghz in piÃ¹ rispetto alla versione KF. Sbloccato a 6.2ghz con max temperatura in game sui 54Â° ovviamente dipende dagli scenari in cyberpunk 2077, Horizon zero dawn e starfield.

Intel Core i7-14700F Desktop Processor 20 cores (8 P-cores + 12 E-cores) up to 5.4 GHz,Wythe,"I ordered 14700F because I need a CPU that has similar performance compared with 14700k but consumes less power, and I was wrong about it.1st of all, the CPU cooler come with the CPU is too weak and it limit the CPU to 65w with continuously load.The 65w power limitation severely undercut CPU performance and I get about 20,000 with Cinebench R23.A powerful cooler is definitely needed to cool down the CPU allowing it to run at 220w.With 220w on the 14700F, Cinebench R23 score has reached 33,000.For me, when 14700f paired with the original cooler, the 65w CPU is too weak for my need.In the meantime, with a powerful cooler, 14700f performs close (but not as fast) as 14700k and the 220w power consumption is not much difference compared with 14700kf's 250w PL2.Considering the price between 14700f and 14700kf, there is not much wattage difference between them.With this reason, I have decided to return it.Bottom line,For a price conscious buyer, then I think I5 is better choice because it is cheaper but performs similar compared to 14700f run at 65 watt.If you need more computing power like me, then I think14700k is a better buy.

Intel Core i5-14500 Desktop Processor 14 cores (6 P-cores + 8 E-cores) up to 5.0 GHz,Carey Holzman,"This is a great product at a great price that runs cool with the included cooler. However, every motherboard manufacturer is now OVER VOLTING the CPUs causing them to run hotter and be less efficient so they can pass benchmarks with slightly higher scores at the cost of cooking your CPU. Look up the PL1 (long term power) and PL2 (short term power) ratings for your CPU and compare it to the massive over-volting your motherboard is doing to it without your knowledge or consent.In this case, the PL1 on a 14500 is 65w and the PL2 is 154w. My AsRock board was over-volting this to 219w+!!! No wonder it was cooking the CPU. This is not even an over-clockable CPU!There is a setting in the AsRock BIOS EZ screen to ENABLE INTEL POWER LIMITS, but it does not work! You need to go to advanced settings and find the long and short power limits and put them back MANUALLY to Intel's specifications.Now your chip will not over-heat, will cost less money to run, will last longer, be more reliable and you do NOT need to waste your money on more expensive coolers or thermal paste, nor waste your time installing and wiring all that up!!!!!!!

I decided it was time..well, actually I got the itch.I decided to go with the 14700K for a few reasons. One is that it's the only 14th gen part from Intel that got a significant upgrade (four more e-cores and 8 more threads, plus a small clock boost).I also don't like that the 3DFX part from AMD had caused some minor issues for people, and I definitely don't like the RAM issues I see all the time on AMD systems. If it wasn't for the RAM issues, I may have gone AMD this time. Out of all the Intel systems I have assembled for customers over the years, I have not once come across a RAM issue that wasn't caused by bad RAM.This CPU is working perfectly, and gaming excellently. Gaming benchmarks show it to be a very good CPU, and I am not having any issues with it.If you are interested in any other Intel parts, I suggest going with 13th gen as you will basically get the same part for less money. For an i7 system though, this is an excellent CPU and a half decent upgrade over the previous gen."

I used an ASUS Z690-F motherboard, which did NOT recognize the memory (I used 64GB Corsair at 5200MHz); the machine simply wouldn't boot and the orange light on the motherboard indicated DRAM issues. After much reading, I found that it was necessary to update the BIOS using the rear FLASHBACK port. Once that was done, the operation was successful and I haven't had any major issues.

I installed a 120mm Cooler Master Lite radiator to control the processor because, incredibly, the KRAKEN x73 360mm was not able to keep the temperatures in check. The 120mm Cooler Master keeps the processor between 32 and 40 degrees with minimal load, and at maximum load and tests, it hits 80 degrees, which is simply great considering the maximum temperature of the processor is 125 degrees. I attached two Noctua fans at 3000 RPM in a push/pull configuration to the radiator.

Silent Loop 360 cooler, I use it at 5.5 GHz P-core and 4.0 E-core with about 1.280v, temperatures in Cinebench reach 90 degrees in summer for a score of 38k, in winter it stays around 80 degrees, in games during summer it ranges from 60 to 72 depending on the game, never reaching 80 degrees in-game. And it consumes between 90 and 130w."

Be careful to not bend or break the pins. Apply thermal paste any way you like, thare is no ""best"" way - I go with an X pattern. The most important part is to ensure an even spread of paste on the dye, without any air gaps. You  can test how good your coverage is by applying the paste in any pattern you like, sit and press the cooler on the dye, then remove it and examine. If the spread/coverage looks good, clean the processor and cooler dyes, reapply paste, reseat and mount the cooler.

My specs are as followsI9 14900k @5.6ghzH100i 360mm all in one idle 28c/underload 40c48gb 6000mhz ramMSI 3090ti Suprem X 24gbNow to begin with this was a beast of a CPU and then 2 months later without any updates going in that changed.MW3 was plagued with Directx Errors/constant crashes. Helldivers2 wouldn't boot. I was offline for 6 days which is alot of time trying to find a fault with your pc when you ain't finding it. I have now found a work around that makes games play but now the CPU has to be underclocked to handle games - I know this doesn't make sense but intel are aware of the defect and it affects the 13900k also.Be sure to have a good look online as I am looking to return mine to manufacturer due to not being as described. Having g to underclock it to be useful is not what I purchased.Good luck and I hope this review helps you!

This just shows how intense this product is. Even throttled and paired with an RTX 4080 Super, there are no issues with lag or FPS. I use this combo with a 21:9 ultra-wide LED screen in 4K HDR at 100 fps, and all my games, multimedia, and background tasks run smoothly, thanks to its 24 cores keeping my framerate maxed out on all the most demanding games. I highly recommend it for multitasking, gaming (minimum 4K), video editing, etc. Thank you, Intel, for this delicious chicken! 🍗 🥳

I have had the ryzen since launch.I was expecting similar performance maybe slightly better. However, this i5-13400f not only performs better than my old ryzen. It also does it at much cooler temps then the ryzen put out. My ryzen idled at 35c and got up to around 79c on heavy load. The i5 idles at 22c and has only gotten as high as 55c max under heavy land. That's 13 degrees cooler than the ryzen at idle and 24 degrees cooler under load.With that said that's a huge improvement over my old ryzen. Which I shouldn't be surprised that ryzen is a few generations old now. But damn. Definitely worth grabbing one.My old ryzen would get bogged down if I created a video game asset in blender around if I went too crazy. So far the i5 hasn't been bothered by anything I do in blender. Or in zbrush, maya, 3ds max, or substance painter.

I set the INTEL profile (found among those available in the bios), such as PL1 65w and PL2 154w and testing I reach not to have personal performance in any mode (at most 2/3fps at least but sleep at night the same). 2) IF YOU HAVE AMD GPU: to activate the RESIZABLE BAR in the bios you must first enable the voice ''above 4g decoding'', make the pc always access the bios and then activate the ''resizable bar''... if not, it may happen that the card does not risk applying in contemporary modifications of these two variables will be blocked in a BOOTLOOP (to do this you just need to reset the BIOS by short-circuiting two pins on the motherboard).

Despite it bottlenecking against my 2080 Ti, it still ran cool under a 360mm CLC, topping out at no more than 51 degrees C gaming (GPU load) and 60 degrees under full CPU loads. But since the current market for new components is pretty good, I opted to go all in on a 13th gen build rather than find a better X99 motherboard.Odds are, you're probably going to be cross shopping the i5-13600K with the i7-13700K and the i9-13900K. Unless your workflow necessitates the additional core count or you're chasing records, the performance difference between those CPUs and the 13600K did not seem worth the hundreds of dollars of additional cost and the massive increase in peak power consumption. Power also equals heat, and that was another motivating factor for going with the 13600K, having been accustomed to a relatively cool and quiet build for some time. That said; with the additional cores and much higher boost frequency, I was expecting higher peak power draw and temps despite a lower TDP on paper.And they were definitely higher, under the same 360mm CLC. After running benchmarks with Cinebench and 3DMark, I was hitting peak temps in the mid-to-high 70s under full CPU loads. Gaming loads however were definitely more manageable though, sitting in the 40s and seldom breaking 50 degrees, which was actually a small but appreciable improvement over the 5960X. I'd advise at minimum a high quality air cooler or a 240mm CLC for this processor.The out of the box performance is something else though. I managed to hit 23345 on a multi-core Cinebench test and a 16459 combined score on 3DMark Time Spy. Again, this is stock clocks paired with an overclocked 2080 Ti and 32GB of DDR5 at 5600 MHz. At 3440 x 1440 and 144Hz, games run like butter. I could dabble in overclocking it since I have the headroom but honestly, I don't see the point. It's fantastic as is.All in all, I feel like the 13600K is kind of the no-brainer option for most people looking to put together a high-end system on a budget. You're getting most of the performance of it's more expensive stablemates for a much lower price and less obnoxiously high power and cooling requirements. The KF is also a little cheaper if you don't need integrated graphics. Just buy it. You'll love it.

Firstly, this processor offers solid performance for daily tasks and gaming. Single-core performance is good, and its multithreaded capability efficiently handles heavier workloads. I've noticed a significant improvement compared to my old processor, resulting in a smoother and more responsive experience.

However, I must highlight that the price of this processor is somewhat high for the year 2023. With technology evolving rapidly, it's possible to find processors offering similar performance at a lower price. If you're looking for a budget-friendly processor, it might be wise to consider other options on the market.

Additionally, it's important to note that this processor is based on the Alder Lake architecture, which is relatively new. This means there could be compatibility issues or adjustments needed for certain older software or games. Make sure to check compatibility with your setup before purchasing.

In conclusion, the Intel Core i5-13500 processor delivers satisfactory performance for daily tasks and gaming. However, the higher price compared to other market options and potential compatibility issues are factors to consider. If you're willing to invest in a latest-generation processor, this one will meet your performance needs, but exploring other options might offer better value for money."

Also as temperature we are (if activated in the BIOS the E-CORE starts to heat up ... also if used in a tower heatsink with two fans I have never exceeded 85 degrees, not even in this deep space). Be careful to set the BIOS for this beast, I have written some things to do to avoid problems: 1) pay attention to the CPU power profile, it will be like having a PL1 of 115w and a PL2 of 254w (depends on the producer of the mother board, but good or bad and values ??are these), the processor as it seems... I set the INTEL profile (found among those available in the bios), such as PL1 65w and PL2 154w and testing I reach not to have personal performance in any mode (at most 2/3fps at least but sleep at night the same). 2) IF YOU HAVE AMD GPU: to activate the RESIZABLE BAR in the bios you must first enable the voice ''above 4g decoding'', make the pc always access the bios and then activate the ''resizable bar''... if not, it may happen that the card does not risk applying in contemporary modifications of these two variables will be blocked in a BOOTLOOP (to do this you just need to reset the BIOS by short-circuiting two pins on the motherboard). Otherwise, the excellent CPU is very satisfied.  "

Product Name Not Found,Rami alsari,As expected
Product Name Not Found,Dave Hammers Tech Garage,"ð I start from the conclusions: it is a truly remarkable CPU, I own a pair of 12900k on other builds but this 13700k in some respects is more performing.I am not a player and I use PCs for work.My experience is therefore aimed at professionals who work with videos, photos, 3D reconstructions, 3D editing, photogrammetries etc. etc., unlike the 12900k (on Mobo Asus Proart Z690-Creator WiFi with Deepcool LS720 and Asus Rog Strix Z690-A Gaming WiFi D4 with Itk Evoli 240 Argb both with the Thermalright frame) that mounted without touching the bios do not shoot Watt absurdi (but I think it depends more on the BIOS that from the CPU), this 12700k (on Mobo Asus Proart B760-Creator WiFiWith Noctua NH-D15 Chromax.Black and Frame of Thermalright), he warms a little more. In the 700k compared to 13900k, always reviewed here on Amazon, I didn't want to intervene from the BIOS also because after the first minutes in stress tests, for example with Cinebench 23, during which the Bios always pushes the processor to the limit (over 360 watts), everything calms down.The boost lasts a few moments and immediately after the consumption stands on the 253 watts, consequently the temperatures also drop, so much so that the average ones of the cores hardly exceed 90 degrees (in the 10 min test) â ï¸ the processorIt offers really excellent performances, all programs run smoothly like oil, thanks also to the 64 GB of memory.The Adobe Suite, from Photoshop to After Effects, from Illustrator to Premiere Pro, Blender, 4D Cinema and Metashape Pro (i.e. the programs that I use most) are supported by so much power and have no hesitation.Also with different applications open on 13700K, it works largely .ph on Cinebench R23 the score is 28550 on the single render, maximum temperatures of the core 4, 5 and 7 (the most hot) of 100 ° while in the Throttling test of10 min The score was 27497 with maximum temperatures of 100 ° respectively for Core 3, 5 and 7c.A difference in only 3.69 % between the single render and the Throttling test.Not bad! In the Throttling test of 10 min, the maximum values ​​of the individual cores vary between 93 ° and 100 °, while the average ones between 83 ° -85 °, therefore more than acceptable.The maximum consumption is 351 watts while the average 260 watts. In idle the temperatures vary between 21 ° and 47 °. You can check from the photos ð ost. we now have to the other info: ð shipping: perfect, asThe whole Amazon purchase process.The times have been respected and the packaging was adequate. Oph ¦ Pacco and content: the package, compared to the most famous 13900, is almost poor .. the CPU is located inside a cardboard box protected by the classicplastic houses.The only care is to identify the small triangle on the CPU, at the bottom to the left, and place it in correspondence with the triangle visible on the fixing support of the socket present on the mobo.Personally, to avoid the phenomenon of flexion that can occur on the LGA 1700 socket, I have using the frame of the thermalright.ð ´ useful info: many advise the use of an at least 240 aio, reliable and powerful.This time, however, I wanted to try top of the range heatsink and I must say that it offers no indifferent performances: performances against: -ð ¥ ï¸ The Buildmobo: Asus Proart B760 -CreatorWIFFUPU: Intel I7 13700K With Thermalright LGA1700-BCFCOOLER: Noctua NH-D15 Chromax.Blackram: Corsair Vengeance DDR5 RAM 64GB (2x32GB) 5600MHz CL40SSD System: Crucial P5 Plus 2TB SSDGPU: NVIDIA RTX A4000 16 850E (2023) Houses:Fractal Design North Charcoal Black Tempered Glass Dark"

"IntelÂ® Core i3-10100 Processor (6M Cache, up to 4.30 GHz) BGA 437 Socket",Big Orange Wookie,"DISCLAIMER: This review covers 3 main items (CPU, MOBO, RAM). Links to the other parts are included (all available at Amazon for good prices). You'll read this review on each of the other parts as well.WHY DID I BUY IT? I recently built and absolute beast of a computer and kept my older one as a backup. Unfortunately, it decided to take a dive this past week with the motherboard failing catastropically. Given that it was 10 years old, I decided to replace the ""brains"" with something a little more modern, but not overkill. Because I had spent a LOT of money on a computer recently, I was trying to keep the repair under about $400 and here's what I did...The BRAINS...Intel i3-10100 Processor ($100): www.amazon.com/gp/product/B086MMRW87MSI Mag B460 Motherboard ($110): www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08GXVP1DMTeamGroup 16GB DDR4 ($60): www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07WNQVBZ6*** These are the main parts that MUST be compatible.. and they are ***I was worried about my hard drive, so I went ahead and splurged on a TeamGroup 1TB SSD ($75 -- www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PX2KKHM) bringing my total to just under $400. I could have kept my old Seagate 500gb 5400 RPM drive but I had a little extra to spend and that greatly sped up boot and wait times.For what it's worth, I also kept my existing Antec Power Supply (550W) that was replaced about a year ago, my case, and my now very old graphics card (R9 380 - 4gb). I already had a good monitor, mouse, and keyboard so those carried over as well.So how did it go together? Pretty seamlessly with just 2 little hiccups.HICCUP #1RAM: I did not realize the motherboard I purchased has a standard RAM speed of 2666. It can get up to a max of 2933. So the RAM I purchased (3200 speed, CL 16) is overkill and I could have saved another $20 or so. But, I didn't... and it's my first build with TeamGroup RAM and I'm happy with it.HICCUP #2LAN/AUDIO: Once I got everything installed, the LAN would not connect to my network (wired, ethernet connection). A little troubleshooting found out YOU MUST TO UPGRADE THE LAN DRIVER for it to work. This means having another computer with internet and a flash drive. Likewise, I went ahead and updated the Audio driver and the sound was much crisper. So... take a moment and download all of the drivers in advance from the MSI website.FIRST POWER ON: The computer started up, then turned off immediately. It then restarted on it's own and said the motherboard had detected changes so I needed to configure the BIOS. Entering BIOS found that everything was recognized. So I changed the first boot device to USB flash drive and plugged in my Windows 10 install flash drive and restarted.Bottom Line: The Intel i3-10100 is a great little chip (not overclockable). The MSI 460 Torpedo is a decent motherboard (just update the LAN and Audio drivers) that boots quickly. In fact, it boots so quickly, I don't even see the POST screen. From cold to Windows is easily under 30 seconds.The RAM is stable at 2666 and fast enough that I probably won't even push the 2933 setting. The SSD is very fast (functionally almost as fast as the M2 drive I have in my beast at a savings of $20-25). Even with the aging R9 graphics card, I'm easily hitting 60 FPS on modern titles at 1080 in medium to high settings. Sometime next year when graphics card prices drop to a reasonable level, I'll update that and have a second gaming rig ready.Overall, I'm very happy with this setup.

If you want DDR4 3200 better go to the 11 management or above.Supports well a GTX 1660 Super.It is not a top machine but it resolves soooo.Except for specific situations of its excellent optimal optimal use.

I find this 10100 one in particular, to give me the biggest bang for my buck! You have to spend quite a bit more to get more performance, and even then you'd only get like 15 to 25% more. The performance per CPU of this beauty is fantastic, plus you get more than ample performance when running many threads.

Intel Core i5 12600K 12 Gen Generation Desktop PC Processor CPU with 20MB Cache and up to 4.90 GHz Clock Speed 3 Years Warranty with Fan LGA 1700 Socket No Graphic Card Required,Eoin Madsen,"This seems like a good CPU so far but it was packaged very poorly - the chip was literally rattling around loose inside the Amazon box. I found a small roll of bubble wrap that was presumably lightly taped around it when it was first put into the box. There was no plastic clam-shell cover, no anti-static bag, and no Intel product box. It was not listed here as used, b-stock, or otherwise, but even if it had been this packaging would not be acceptable. The price I paid was certainly for a new i5-12600K in any case.If I were not so far away (Ireland), I would have returned it on principle, but I don't want to have to wait for a replacement unless I have no choice.

Intel Core i7-12700K Desktop Processor 12 (8P+4E) Cores up to 5.0 GHz Unlocked LGA 1700 600 Series Chipset 125W,Anish Roy,"No doubt, 12th gen Intel processors are a marvel of computing technology. Although there is a continuing tug of war between Intel and AMD in this regard. I personally chose Intel Core i7 (12700K) with inbuilt UHD graphics for my newly built desktop PC. For those, who don't want to use a separate and usually exorbitantly priced graphics cards, this processor is a very good alternative. It can handle most of the processing intensive rendering of Blender easily with its unlocked overclocking (obviously you have to use the supporting motherboard, i.e. presently available Z690 chipset motherboards). It can also smoothly handle almost all the tasks of Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop with no hiccups. Not to mention the support of 4K video with HDR if you are looking for some decent and the latest entertainment in your PC. I would suggest this 12th Gen i7 to those who want to use their PC for content creation purpose in the best possible way and also at the same time save some money (compared to 12th Gen i9, which would ideally be the best anyway, but costlier too). The price is still at a high level. Hopefully this comes down soon with the launch of Intel's 13th Gen processors!

Intel Core i7-12700K Desktop Processor 12 (8P+4E) Cores up to 5.0 GHz Unlocked LGA 1700 600 Series Chipset 125W,Jacob,"I upgraded to this CPU after some HEAVY research, asking Reddit (Both Intel and AMD subreddits), weighing in money VS performance gained. I have used AMD since I was a teen and started building computers. The conclusion is this: It is an amazing CPU, runs faster and cooler than my Ryzen 7 1700. The price AND performance VS AMD (Also including a board) was better than if I had went with a Ryzen 7 5800X.Some background information: I wanted to upgrade after receiving an Amazon gift card (I have never ordered computer parts from Amazon though). I upgraded from a Ryzen 7 1700, with an ASUS x370-f board. I really wanted to upgrade, and was sad also that Windows 11 did not support my CPU! I will give it to Microsoft for this, as it made A LOT of people upgrade their entire computers, all for basically the same OS as of now with newer looks, and not much done under the hood (EXCEPT for 12th gen Intel, so good news there too). Sadly, my old board STILL doesn't support the Ryzen 7 5000 series, and only the 3000 series (They are working on a BIOS apparently for the 5000 series, because of people who were in my shoes). I first almost ordered the Ryzen 7 3800XT, for $400! After a couple hours of research, asking, and thinking about it... I cancelled that order (Thankfully) and thought ""Well, if I am going to spend this much on upgrading my CPU, I might as well go all in/spend a little more for something better, as this may be my last big upgrade in this regard for awhile."" I was then going to get the Ryzen 7 5800X with an Asus board. There lied a problem of price, I could not find a board AND get that CPU still within my budget (At-least not a board that wasn't worse than the one I had in ways). I mentioned I had posted on the AMD subreddit, and even they suggested I go Intel (Intel is just killing it as of now, hands down, although I am sure AMD will retaliate). I ended up getting the MSI Z690-A DDR4 (I wish I had the money for DDR5 RAM, I would have went with the DDR5 version as it was basically the same price). I had A LOT of second thoughts on this board though, as it just didn't seem ""Premium"" as the one I had (I am going to do a whole review on it after this. I'll save my Pros & Cons for there.) This CPU also auto-clocks itself up or down depending on the load (Saw it clock down to 1GHz, although not for long, for example if not much processing power is warranted, which makes sense and I wish everything did). So if idling, it will clock down and save power/heat/and therefore longevity is increased. I absolutely love this CPU coming from AMD. Anyways...If you have a Corsair H100I RGB Platinum or similar cooler already: The included 1200 screws work just fine with the 1700 socket and this CPU, even though you are supposed to get the 1700 kit/screws for this CPU (Which I did, but they are taking FOREVER to ship, so I googled, and someone said using the 1200 screws will work just fine). I get better temps. than my Ryzen 7 1700. I can even overclock EVEN MORE but have no need, and no point.TL:DRUpgraded from: Ryzen 7 1700, Asus Rog Strix x370-f gaming.Upgraded to: i7-12700K, MSI Z690-A DDR4.Parts kept: 4x8GB 32GB DDR4 CL16 3000MHz RAM (With XMP, D.O.C.P), RTX 2070. The RAM works great with this CPU as well, although it TECHNICALLY (Latency wise, runs at 2T on Intel instead of 1T on AMD) runs slower than when on AMD (AMD's infinity fabric) but obviously whatever Intel is doing makes up for that, and therefore my RAM either runs faster/the same)Pros: It is an amazing CPU for price VS performance. The i5-12600K is good as well (I almost just went with it), and you would be fine going with it for gaming (As even it still has more cores technically than the Ryzen 7 5800X, it also beats the 5800X even though THIS CPU is supposed to be its comparison rival brother.) This CPU has cool temps on my Corsair H100I RGB Platinum cooler, and the P&E core structure are REALLY cool and fun to watch when doing tasks/gaming. It shipped fast!Cons: Literally none with the CPU itself. Just with shipping - It shipped really fast! Was here in 2-3 days after purchasing on here. The biggest complaint I have is Amazon's shipping (SO BE AWARE OF THIS) I have never ordered computer parts from Amazon, and have always used New-egg. They just left the CPU in my mail-box, and if it weren't for me looking at my camera's, and looking out for this part, it would have sat in the mail-box all day. My mail-box sadly is not very weather proof as well, and if it had been raining... It wouldn't have been good. Although it did come in a big box around it. The CPU also was jarred loose and flopping around in the box (Not held into the front window).I hope this review helps people!

My mail-box sadly is not very weather proof as well, and if it had been raining... It wouldn't have been good. Although it did come in a big box around it. The CPU also was jarred loose and flopping around in the box (Not held into the front window).I hope this review helps people!

Although there is a continuing tug of war between Intel and AMD in this regard. I personally chose Intel Core i7 (12700K) with inbuilt UHD graphics for my newly built desktop PC. For those, who don't want to use a separate and usually exorbitantly priced graphics cards, this processor is a very good alternative. It can handle most of the processing intensive rendering of Blender easily with its unlocked overclocking (obviously you have to use the supporting motherboard, i.e. presently available Z690 chipset motherboards). It can also smoothly handle almost all the tasks of Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop with no hiccups. Not to mention the support of 4K video with HDR if you are looking for some decent and the latest entertainment in your PC. I would suggest this 12th Gen i7 to those who want to use their PC for content creation purpose in the best possible way and also at the same time save some money (compared to 12th Gen i9, which would ideally be the best anyway, but costlier too). The price is still at a high level. Hopefully this comes down soon with the launch of Intel's 13th Gen processors!

Intel Core i7-12700K Desktop Processor 12 (8P+4E) Cores up to 5.0 GHz Unlocked LGA 1700 600 Series Chipset 125W,Jacob,"I upgraded to this CPU after some HEAVY research, asking Reddit (Both Intel and AMD subreddits), weighing in money VS performance gained. I have used AMD since I was a teen and started building computers. The conclusion is this: It is an amazing CPU, runs faster and cooler than my Ryzen 7 1700. The price AND performance VS AMD (Also including a board) was better than if I had went with a Ryzen 7 5800X.Some background information: I wanted to upgrade after receiving an Amazon gift card (I have never ordered computer parts from Amazon though). I upgraded from a Ryzen 7 1700, with an ASUS x370-f board. I really wanted to upgrade, and was sad also that Windows 11 did not support my CPU! I will give it to Microsoft for this, as it made A LOT of people upgrade their entire computers, all for basically the same OS as of now with newer looks, and not much done under the hood (EXCEPT for 12th gen Intel, so good news there too). Sadly, my old board STILL doesn't support the Ryzen 7 5000 series, and only the 3000 series (They are working on a BIOS apparently for the 5000 series, because of people who were in my shoes). I first almost ordered the Ryzen 7 3800XT, for $400! After a couple hours of research, asking, and thinking about it... I cancelled that order (Thankfully) and thought ""Well, if I am going to spend this much on upgrading my CPU, I might as well go all in/spend a little more for something better, as this may be my last big upgrade in this regard for awhile."" I was then going to get the Ryzen 7 5800X with an Asus board. There lied a problem of price, I could not find a board AND get that CPU still within my budget (At-least not a board that wasn't worse than the one I had in ways). I mentioned I had posted on the AMD subreddit, and even they suggested I go Intel (Intel is just killing it as of now, hands down, although I am sure AMD will retaliate). I ended up getting the MSI Z690-A DDR4 (I wish I had the money for DDR5 RAM, I would have went with the DDR5 version as it was basically the same price). I had A LOT of second thoughts on this board though, as it just didn't seem ""Premium"" as the one I had (I am going to do a whole review on it after this. I'll save my Pros & Cons for there.) This CPU also auto-clocks itself up or down depending on the load (Saw it clock down to 1GHz, although not for long, for example if not much processing power is warranted, which makes sense and I wish everything did). So if idling, it will clock down and save power/heat/and therefore longevity is increased. I absolutely love this CPU coming from AMD. Anyways...If you have a Corsair H100I RGB Platinum or similar cooler already: The included 1200 screws work just fine with the 1700 socket and this CPU, even though you are supposed to get the 1700 kit/screws for this CPU (Which I did, but they are taking FOREVER to ship, so I googled, and someone said using the 1200 screws will work just fine). I get better temps. than my Ryzen 7 1700. I can even overclock EVEN MORE but have no need, and no point.TL:DRUpgraded from: Ryzen 7 1700, Asus Rog Strix x370-f gaming.Upgraded to: i7-12700K, MSI Z690-A DDR4.Parts kept: 4x8GB 32GB DDR4 CL16 3000MHz RAM (With XMP, D.O.C.P), RTX 2070. The RAM works great with this CPU as well, although it TECHNICALLY (Latency wise, runs at 2T on Intel instead of 1T on AMD) runs slower than when on AMD (AMD's infinity fabric) but obviously whatever Intel is doing makes up for that, and therefore my RAM either runs faster/the same)Pros: It is an amazing CPU for price VS performance. The i5-12600K is good as well (I almost just went with it), and you would be fine going with it for gaming (As even it still has more cores technically than the Ryzen 7 5800X, it also beats the 5800X even though THIS CPU is supposed to be its comparison rival brother.) This CPU has cool temps on my Corsair H100I RGB Platinum cooler, and the P&E core structure are REALLY cool and fun to watch when doing tasks/gaming. It shipped fast!Cons: Literally none with the CPU itself. Just with shipping - It shipped really fast! Was here in 2-3 days after purchasing on here.

Intel Core i7-12700K Desktop Processor 12 (8P+4E) Cores up to 5.0 GHz Unlocked LGA 1700 600 Series Chipset 125W,Jacob,"I upgraded to this CPU after some HEAVY research, asking Reddit (Both Intel and AMD subreddits), weighing in money VS performance gained. I have used AMD since I was a teen and started building computers. The conclusion is this: It is an amazing CPU, runs faster and cooler than my Ryzen 7 1700. The price AND performance VS AMD (Also including a board) was better than if I had went with a Ryzen 7 5800X.Some background information: I wanted to upgrade after receiving an Amazon gift card (I have never ordered computer parts from Amazon though). I upgraded from a Ryzen 7 1700, with an ASUS x370-f board. I really wanted to upgrade, and was sad also that Windows 11 did not support my CPU! I will give it to Microsoft for this, as it made A LOT of people upgrade their entire computers, all for basically the same OS as of now with newer looks, and not much done under the hood (EXCEPT for 12th gen Intel, so good news there too). Sadly, my old board STILL doesn't support the Ryzen 7 5000 series, and only the 3000 series (They are working on a BIOS apparently for the 5000 series, because of people who were in my shoes). I first almost ordered the Ryzen 7 3800XT, for $400! After a couple hours of research, asking, and thinking about it... I cancelled that order (Thankfully) and thought ""Well, if I am going to spend this much on upgrading my CPU, I might as well go all in/spend a little more for something better, as this may be my last big upgrade in this regard for awhile."" I was then going to get the Ryzen 7 5800X with an Asus board. There lied a problem of price, I could not find a board AND get that CPU still within my budget (At-least not a board that wasn't worse than the one I had in ways). I mentioned I had posted on the AMD subreddit, and even they suggested I go Intel (Intel is just killing it as of now, hands down, although I am sure AMD will retaliate). I ended up getting the MSI Z690-A DDR4 (I wish I had the money for DDR5 RAM, I would have went with the DDR5 version as it was basically the same price). I had A LOT of second thoughts on this board though, as it just didn't seem ""Premium"" as the one I had (I am going to do a whole review on it after this. I'll save my Pros & Cons for there.) This CPU also auto-clocks itself up or down depending on the load (Saw it clock down to 1GHz, although not for long, for example if not much processing power is warranted, which makes sense and I wish everything did). So if idling, it will clock down and save power/heat/and therefore longevity is increased. I absolutely love this CPU coming from AMD. Anyways...If you have a Corsair H100I RGB Platinum or similar cooler already: The included 1200 screws work just fine with the 1700 socket and this CPU, even though you are supposed to get the 1700 kit/screws for this CPU (Which I did, but they are taking FOREVER to ship, so I googled, and someone said using the 1200 screws will work just fine). I get better temps. than my Ryzen 7 1700. I can even overclock EVEN MORE but have no need, and no point.TL:DRUpgraded from: Ryzen 7 1700, Asus Rog Strix x370-f gaming.Upgraded to: i7-12700K, MSI Z690-A DDR4.Parts kept: 4x8GB 32GB DDR4 CL16 3000MHz RAM (With XMP, D.O.C.P), RTX 2070. The RAM works great with this CPU as well, although it TECHNICALLY (Latency wise, runs at 2T on Intel instead of 1T on AMD) runs slower than when on AMD (AMD's infinity fabric) but obviously whatever Intel is doing makes up for that, and therefore my RAM either runs faster/the same)Pros: It is an amazing CPU for price VS performance. The i5-12600K is good as well (I almost just went with it), and you would be fine going with it for gaming (As even it still has more cores technically than the Ryzen 7 5800X, it also beats the 5800X even though THIS CPU is supposed to be its comparison rival brother.) This CPU has cool temps on my Corsair H100I RGB Platinum cooler, and the P&E core structure are REALLY cool and fun to watch when doing tasks/gaming. It shipped fast!Cons: Literally none with the CPU itself. Just with shipping - It shipped really fast! Was here in 2-3 days after purchasing on here. The biggest complaint I have is Amazon's shipping (SO BE AWARE OF THIS) I have never ordered computer parts from Amazon, and have always used New-egg. They just left the CPU in my mail-box, and if it weren't for me looking at my camera's, and looking out for this part, it would have sat in the mail-box all day. My mail-box sadly is not very weather proof as well, and if it had been raining... It wouldn't have been good. Although it did come in a big box around it. The CPU also was jarred loose and flopping around in the box (Not held into the front window).I hope this review helps people!

Although there is a continuing tug of war between Intel and AMD in this regard. I personally chose Intel Core i7 (12700K) with inbuilt UHD graphics for my newly built desktop PC. For those, who don't want to use a separate and usually exorbitantly priced graphics cards, this processor is a very good alternative. It can handle most of the processing intensive rendering of Blender easily with its unlocked overclocking (obviously you have to use the supporting motherboard, i.e. presently available Z690 chipset motherboards). It can also smoothly handle almost all the tasks of Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop with no hiccups. Not to mention the support of 4K video with HDR if you are looking for some decent and the latest entertainment in your PC. I would suggest this 12th Gen i7 to those who want to use their PC for content creation purpose in the best possible way and also at the same time save some money (compared to 12th Gen i9, which would ideally be the best anyway, but costlier too). The price is still at a high level. Hopefully this comes down soon with the launch of Intel's 13th Gen processors!

Â I recently got my hands on the Intel Core i9-12900K Desktop Processor, and I have to say, I am blown away by its performance. This processor is an absolute powerhouse, with 16 cores (8P+8E) and speeds of up to 5.2 GHz. It's also unlocked, which means I can push its limits even further if I want to.Installing the processor was easy enough, although I did have to make sure my motherboard was compatible with the LGA1700 socket and 600 series chipset. Once I had everything set up, I fired up my favorite games and applications to see how the processor would perform.The results were nothing short of impressive. The i9-12900K chewed through every task I threw at it with ease, from demanding video editing software to the latest AAA games. I was able to multitask without any lag or slowdowns, and my system felt incredibly responsive and snappy.The processor also runs surprisingly cool, even under heavy load. I did notice a slight increase in power consumption compared to my old processor, but it's a small price to pay for the sheer performance boost.Overall, I am extremely satisfied with the Intel Core i9-12900K Desktop Processor. If you're a power user or a gamer who demands the best performance, this processor is definitely worth considering. It's not cheap, but in my opinion, it's worth every penny for the sheer power and speed it delivers.

"IntelÂ® Core i3-10100 Processor (6M Cache, up to 4.30 GHz) BGA 437 Socket",Big Orange Wookie,"DISCLAIMER: This review covers 3 main items (CPU, MOBO, RAM). Links to the other parts are included (all available at Amazon for good prices). You'll read this review on each of the other parts as well.WHY DID I BUY IT? I recently built and absolute beast of a computer and kept my older one as a backup. Unfortunately, it decided to take a dive this past week with the motherboard failing catastropically. Given that it was 10 years old, I decided to replace the ""brains"" with something a little more modern, but not overkill. Because I had spent a LOT of money on a computer recently, I was trying to keep the repair under about $400 and here's what I did...The BRAINS...Intel i3-10100 Processor ($100): www.amazon.com/gp/product/B086MMRW87MSI Mag B460 Motherboard ($110): www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08GXVP1DMTeamGroup 16GB DDR4 ($60): www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07WNQVBZ6*** These are the main parts that MUST be compatible.. and they are ***I was worried about my hard drive, so I went ahead and splurged on a TeamGroup 1TB SSD ($75 -- www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PX2KKHM) bringing my total to just under $400. I could have kept my old Seagate 500gb 5400 RPM drive but I had a little extra to spend and that greatly sped up boot and wait times.For what it's worth, I also kept my existing Antec Power Supply (550W) that was replaced about a year ago, my case, and my now very old graphics card (R9 380 - 4gb). I already had a good monitor, mouse, and keyboard so those carried over as well.So how did it go together? Pretty seamlessly with just 2 little hiccups.HICCUP #1RAM: I did not realize the motherboard I purchased has a standard RAM speed of 2666. It can get up to a max of 2933. So the RAM I purchased (3200 speed, CL 16) is overkill and I could have saved another $20 or so. But, I didn't... and it's my first build with TeamGroup RAM and I'm happy with it.HICCUP #2LAN/AUDIO: Once I got everything installed, the LAN would not connect to my network (wired, ethernet connection). A little troubleshooting found out YOU MUST TO UPGRADE THE LAN DRIVER for it to work. This means having another computer with internet and a flash drive. Likewise, I went ahead and updated the Audio driver and the sound was much crisper. So... take a moment and download all of the drivers in advance from the MSI website.FIRST POWER ON: The computer started up, then turned off immediately. It then restarted on it's own and said the motherboard had detected changes so I needed to configure the BIOS. Entering BIOS found that everything was recognized. So I changed the first boot device to USB flash drive and plugged in my Windows 10 install flash drive and restarted.Bottom Line: The Intel i3-10100 is a great little chip (not overclockable). The MSI 460 Torpedo is a decent motherboard (just update the LAN and Audio drivers) that boots quickly. In fact, it boots so quickly, I don't even see the POST screen. From cold to Windows is easily under 30 seconds.The RAM is stable at 2666 and fast enough that I probably won't even push the 2933 setting. The SSD is very fast (functionally almost as fast as the M2 drive I have in my beast at a savings of $20-25). Even with the aging R9 graphics card, I'm easily hitting 60 FPS on modern titles at 1080 in medium to high settings. Sometime next year when graphics card prices drop to a reasonable level, I'll update that and have a second gaming rig ready.Overall, I'm very happy with this setup.

Intel, with this range, made a nice leap forward and on the entry level market it was definitely placed in front of the dear old Ryzen.I built a Build for domestic/small office with a few hundred euros, and the result was more than excellent! I remember that for those who are looking for a decent build (not devoted to gaming) this is an excellentchoice, also considering the integrated graphics that saves on the video card.And for those who want to take a little playful moment, here Fortnite and similar titles do not struggle. The only flaw (but the period is what it is) is that there are few LGA 1200 mothers at a consonation price.

Because I had spent a LOT of money on a computer recently, I was trying to keep the repair under about $400 and here's what I did...The BRAINS...Intel i3-10100 Processor ($100): www.amazon.com/gp/product/B086MMRW87MSI Mag B460 Motherboard ($110): www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08GXVP1DMTeamGroup 16GB DDR4 ($60): www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07WNQVBZ6*** These are the main parts that MUST be compatible.. and they are ***I was worried about my hard drive, so I went ahead and splurged on a TeamGroup 1TB SSD ($75 -- www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PX2KKHM) bringing my total to just under $400. I could have kept my old Seagate 500gb 5400 RPM drive but I had a little extra to spend and that greatly sped up boot and wait times.For what it's worth, I also kept my existing Antec Power Supply (550W) that was replaced about a year ago, my case, and my now very old graphics card (R9 380 - 4gb). I already had a good monitor, mouse, and keyboard so those carried over as well.So how did it go together? Pretty seamlessly with just 2 little hiccups.HICCUP #1RAM: I did not realize the motherboard I purchased has a standard RAM speed of 2666. It can get up to a max of 2933. So the RAM I purchased (3200 speed, CL 16) is overkill and I could have saved another $20 or so. But, I didn't... and it's my first build with TeamGroup RAM and I'm happy with it.HICCUP #2LAN/AUDIO: Once I got everything installed, the LAN would not connect to my network (wired, ethernet connection). A little troubleshooting found out YOU MUST TO UPGRADE THE LAN DRIVER for it to work. This means having another computer with internet and a flash drive. Likewise, I went ahead and updated the Audio driver and the sound was much crisper. So... take a moment and download all of the drivers in advance from the MSI website.FIRST POWER ON: The computer started up, then turned off immediately. It then restarted on it's own and said the motherboard had detected changes so I needed to configure the BIOS. Entering BIOS found that everything was recognized. So I changed the first boot device to USB flash drive and plugged in my Windows 10 install flash drive and restarted.Bottom Line: The Intel i3-10100 is a great little chip (not overclockable). The MSI 460 Torpedo is a decent motherboard (just update the LAN and Audio drivers) that boots quickly. In fact, it boots so quickly, I don't even see the POST screen. From cold to Windows is easily under 30 seconds.The RAM is stable at 2666 and fast enough that I probably won't even push the 2933 setting. The SSD is very fast (functionally almost as fast as the M2 drive I have in my beast at a savings of $20-25). Even with the aging R9 graphics card, I'm easily hitting 60 FPS on modern titles at 1080 in medium to high settings. Sometime next year when graphics card prices drop to a reasonable level, I'll update that and have a second gaming rig ready.Overall, I'm very happy with this setup.

"IntelÂ® Core i3-10100 Processor (6M Cache, up to 4.30 GHz) BGA 437 Socket",Big Orange Wookie,"DISCLAIMER: This review covers 3 main items (CPU, MOBO, RAM). Links to the other parts are included (all available at Amazon for good prices). You'll read this review on each of the other parts as well.WHY DID I BUY IT? I recently built and absolute beast of a computer and kept my older one as a backup. Unfortunately, it decided to take a dive this past week with the motherboard failing catastropically. Given that it was 10 years old, I decided to replace the ""brains"" with something a little more modern, but not overkill. Because I had spent a LOT of money on a computer recently, I was trying to keep the repair under about $400 and here's what I did...The BRAINS...Intel i3-10100 Processor ($100): www.amazon.com/gp/product/B086MMRW87MSI Mag B460 Motherboard ($110): www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08GXVP1DMTeamGroup 16GB DDR4 ($60): www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07WNQVBZ6*** These are the main parts that MUST be compatible.. and they are ***I was worried about my hard drive, so I went ahead and splurged on a TeamGroup 1TB SSD ($75 -- www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PX2KKHM) bringing my total to just under $400. I could have kept my old Seagate 500gb 5400 RPM drive but I had a little extra to spend and that greatly sped up boot and wait times.For what it's worth, I also kept my existing Antec Power Supply (550W) that was replaced about a year ago, my case, and my now very old graphics card (R9 380 - 4gb). I already had a good monitor, mouse, and keyboard so those carried over as well.So how did it go together? Pretty seamlessly with just 2 little hiccups.HICCUP #1RAM: I did not realize the motherboard I purchased has a standard RAM speed of 2666. It can get up to a max of 2933. So the RAM I purchased (3200 speed, CL 16) is overkill and I could have saved another $20 or so. But, I didn't... and it's my first build with TeamGroup RAM and I'm happy with it.HICCUP #2LAN/AUDIO: Once I got everything installed, the LAN would not connect to my network (wired, ethernet connection). A little troubleshooting found out YOU MUST TO UPGRADE THE LAN DRIVER for it to work. This means having another computer with internet and a flash drive. Likewise, I went ahead and updated the Audio driver and the sound was much crisper. So... take a moment and download all of the drivers in advance from the MSI website.FIRST POWER ON: The computer started up, then turned off immediately. It then restarted on it's own and said the motherboard had detected changes so I needed to configure the BIOS. Entering BIOS found that everything was recognized. So I changed the first boot device to USB flash drive and plugged in my Windows 10 install flash drive and restarted.Bottom Line: The Intel i3-10100 is a great little chip (not overclockable). The MSI 460 Torpedo is a decent motherboard (just update the LAN and Audio drivers) that boots quickly. In fact, it boots so quickly, I don't even see the POST screen. From cold to Windows is easily under 30 seconds.The RAM is stable at 2666 and fast enough that I probably won't even push the 2933 setting. The SSD is very fast (functionally almost as fast as the M2 drive I have in my beast at a savings of $20-25). Even with the aging R9 graphics card, I'm easily hitting 60 FPS on modern titles at 1080 in medium to high settings. Sometime next year when graphics card prices drop to a reasonable level, I'll update that and have a second gaming rig ready.Overall, I'm very happy with this setup.

"IntelÂ® Core i3-10100 Processor (6M Cache, up to 4.30 GHz) BGA 437 Socket",Manuel,"Paid 125 euros.A bomb!Entry Level Quad Core, new Chispet LGA 1200. Intel, with this range, made a nice leap forward and on the entry level market it was definitely placed in front of the dear old Ryzen.I built a Build for domestic/small office with a few hundred euros, and the result was more than excellent! I remember that for those who are looking for a decent build (not devoted to gaming) this is an excellentchoice, also considering the integrated graphics that saves on the video card.And for those who want to take a little playful moment, here Fortnite and similar titles do not struggle. The only flaw (but the period is what it is) is that there are few LGA 1200 mothers at a consonation price.

Intel Core i7-12700K Desktop Processor 12 (8P+4E) Cores up to 5.0 GHz Unlocked LGA 1700 600 Series Chipset 125W,Anish Roy,"No doubt, 12th gen Intel processors are a marvel of computing technology. Although there is a continuing tug of war between Intel and AMD in this regard. I personally chose Intel Core i7 (12700K) with inbuilt UHD graphics for my newly built desktop PC. For those, who don't want to use a separate and usually exorbitantly priced graphics cards, this processor is a very good alternative. It can handle most of the processing intensive rendering of Blender easily with its unlocked overclocking (obviously you have to use the supporting motherboard, i.e. presently available Z690 chipset motherboards). It can also smoothly handle almost all the tasks of Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop with no hiccups. Not to mention the support of 4K video with HDR if you are looking for some decent and the latest entertainment in your PC. I would suggest this 12th Gen i7 to those who want to use their PC for content creation purpose in the best possible way and also at the same time save some money (compared to 12th Gen i9, which would ideally be the best anyway, but costlier too). The price is still at a high level. Hopefully this comes down soon with the launch of Intel's 13th Gen processors!

My usage is mostly for Adobe suite for 4K video rendering & photoediting (without dedicated eGPU) and ocassonal AAA title gaming like GTA5, Battlefield, Cpunk,etc.The processor works like a charm for rendering and Games upto 75Hz in 1080p ultra setting.Overall good processor for the price and more review to come in future edits.

Intel Core i7-12700K Desktop Processor 12 (8P+4E) Cores up to 5.0 GHz Unlocked LGA 1700 600 Series Chipset 125W,Jacob,"I upgraded to this CPU after some HEAVY research, asking Reddit (Both Intel and AMD subreddits), weighing in money VS performance gained. I have used AMD since I was a teen and started building computers. The conclusion is this: It is an amazing CPU, runs faster and cooler than my Ryzen 7 1700. The price AND performance VS AMD (Also including a board) was better than if I had went with a Ryzen 7 5800X.Some background information: I wanted to upgrade after receiving an Amazon gift card (I have never ordered computer parts from Amazon though). I upgraded from a Ryzen 7 1700, with an ASUS x370-f board. I really wanted to upgrade, and was sad also that Windows 11 did not support my CPU! I will give it to Microsoft for this, as it made A LOT of people upgrade their entire computers, all for basically the same OS as of now with newer looks, and not much done under the hood (EXCEPT for 12th gen Intel, so good news there too). Sadly, my old board STILL doesn't support the Ryzen 7 5000 series, and only the 3000 series (They are working on a BIOS apparently for the 5000 series, because of people who were in my shoes). I first almost ordered the Ryzen 7 3800XT, for $400! After a couple hours of research, asking, and thinking about it... I cancelled that order (Thankfully) and thought ""Well, if I am going to spend this much on upgrading my CPU, I might as well go all in/spend a little more for something better, as this may be my last big upgrade in this regard for awhile."" I was then going to get the Ryzen 7 5800X with an Asus board. There lied a problem of price, I could not find a board AND get that CPU still within my budget (At-least not a board that wasn't worse than the one I had in ways). I mentioned I had posted on the AMD subreddit, and even they suggested I go Intel (Intel is just killing it as of now, hands down, although I am sure AMD will retaliate). I ended up getting the MSI Z690-A DDR4 (I wish I had the money for DDR5 RAM, I would have went with the DDR5 version as it was basically the same price). I had A LOT of second thoughts on this board though, as it just didn't seem ""Premium"" as the one I had (I am going to do a whole review on it after this. I'll save my Pros & Cons for there.) This CPU also auto-clocks itself up or down depending on the load (Saw it clock down to 1GHz, although not for long, for example if not much processing power is warranted, which makes sense and I wish everything did). So if idling, it will clock down and save power/heat/and therefore longevity is increased. I absolutely love this CPU coming from AMD. Anyways...If you have a Corsair H100I RGB Platinum or similar cooler already: The included 1200 screws work just fine with the 1700 socket and this CPU, even though you are supposed to get the 1700 kit/screws for this CPU (Which I did, but they are taking FOREVER to ship, so I googled, and someone said using the 1200 screws will work just fine). I get better temps. than my Ryzen 7 1700. I can even overclock EVEN MORE but have no need, and no point.TL:DRUpgraded from: Ryzen 7 1700, Asus Rog Strix x370-f gaming.Upgraded to: i7-12700K, MSI Z690-A DDR4.Parts kept: 4x8GB 32GB DDR4 CL16 3000MHz RAM (With XMP, D.O.C.P), RTX 2070. The RAM works great with this CPU as well, although it TECHNICALLY (Latency wise, runs at 2T on Intel instead of 1T on AMD) runs slower than when on AMD (AMD's infinity fabric) but obviously whatever Intel is doing makes up for that, and therefore my RAM either runs faster/the same)Pros: It is an amazing CPU for price VS performance. The i5-12600K is good as well (I almost just went with it), and you would be fine going with it for gaming (As even it still has more cores technically than the Ryzen 7 5800X, it also beats the 5800X even though THIS CPU is supposed to be its comparison rival brother.) This CPU has cool temps on my Corsair H100I RGB Platinum cooler, and the P&E core structure are REALLY cool and fun to watch when doing tasks/gaming. It shipped fast!Cons: Literally none with the CPU itself. Just with shipping - It shipped really fast! Was here in 2-3 days after purchasing on here. The biggest complaint I have is Amazon's shipping (SO BE AWARE OF THIS) I have never ordered computer parts from Amazon, and have always used New-egg. They just left the CPU in my mail-box, and if it weren't for me looking at my camera's, and looking out for this part, it would have sat in the mail-box all day. My mail-box sadly is not very weather proof as well, and if it had been raining... It wouldn't have been good. Although it did come in a big box around it. The CPU also was jarred loose and flopping around in the box (Not held into the front window).I hope this review helps people!

For those, who don't want to use a separate and usually exorbitantly priced graphics cards, this processor is a very good alternative. It can handle most of the processing intensive rendering of Blender easily with its unlocked overclocking (obviously you have to use the supporting motherboard, i.e. presently available Z690 chipset motherboards). It can also smoothly handle almost all the tasks of Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop with no hiccups. Not to mention the support of 4K video with HDR if you are looking for some decent and the latest entertainment in your PC. I would suggest this 12th Gen i7 to those who want to use their PC for content creation purpose in the best possible way and also at the same time save some money (compared to 12th Gen i9, which would ideally be the best anyway, but costlier too). The price is still at a high level. Hopefully this comes down soon with the launch of Intel's 13th Gen processors!

Intel Core i7-12700K Desktop Processor 12 (8P+4E) Cores up to 5.0 GHz Unlocked LGA 1700 600 Series Chipset 125W,Anish Roy,"No doubt, 12th gen Intel processors are a marvel of computing technology. Although there is a continuing tug of war between Intel and AMD in this regard. I personally chose Intel Core i7 (12700K) with inbuilt UHD graphics for my newly built desktop PC. For those, who don't want to use a separate and usually exorbitantly priced graphics cards, this processor is a very good alternative. It can handle most of the processing intensive rendering of Blender easily with its unlocked overclocking (obviously you have to use the supporting motherboard, i.e. presently available Z690 chipset motherboards). It can also smoothly handle almost all the tasks of Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop with no hiccups. Not to mention the support of 4K video with HDR if you are looking for some decent and the latest entertainment in your PC. I would suggest this 12th Gen i7 to those who want to use their PC for content creation purpose in the best possible way and also at the same time save some money (compared to 12th Gen i9, which would ideally be the best anyway, but costlier too). The price is still at a high level. Hopefully this comes down soon with the launch of Intel's 13th Gen processors!

Intel Core i7-12700K Desktop Processor 12 (8P+4E) Cores up to 5.0 GHz Unlocked LGA 1700 600 Series Chipset 125W,Jacob,"I upgraded to this CPU after some HEAVY research, asking Reddit (Both Intel and AMD subreddits), weighing in money VS performance gained. I have used AMD since I was a teen and started building computers. The conclusion is this: It is an amazing CPU, runs faster and cooler than my Ryzen 7 1700. The price AND performance VS AMD (Also including a board) was better than if I had went with a Ryzen 7 5800X.Some background information: I wanted to upgrade after receiving an Amazon gift card (I have never ordered computer parts from Amazon though). I upgraded from a Ryzen 7 1700, with an ASUS x370-f board. I really wanted to upgrade, and was sad also that Windows 11 did not support my CPU! I will give it to Microsoft for this, as it made A LOT of people upgrade their entire computers, all for basically the same OS as of now with newer looks, and not much done under the hood (EXCEPT for 12th gen Intel, so good news there too). Sadly, my old board STILL doesn't support the Ryzen 7 5000 series, and only the 3000 series (They are working on a BIOS apparently for the 5000 series, because of people who were in my shoes). I first almost ordered the Ryzen 7 3800XT, for $400! After a couple hours of research, asking, and thinking about it... I cancelled that order (Thankfully) and thought ""Well, if I am going to spend this much on upgrading my CPU, I might as well go all in/spend a little more for something better, as this may be my last big upgrade in this regard for awhile."" I was then going to get the Ryzen 7 5800X with an Asus board. There lied a problem of price, I could not find a board AND get that CPU still within my budget (At-least not a board that wasn't worse than the one I had in ways). I mentioned I had posted on the AMD subreddit, and even they suggested I go Intel (Intel is just killing it as of now, hands down, although I am sure AMD will retaliate). I ended up getting the MSI Z690-A DDR4 (I wish I had the money for DDR5 RAM, I would have went with the DDR5 version as it was basically the same price). I had A LOT of second thoughts on this board though, as it just didn't seem ""Premium"" as the one I had (I am going to do a whole review on it after this. I'll save my Pros & Cons for there.) This CPU also auto-clocks itself up or down depending on the load (Saw it clock down to 1GHz, although not for long, for example if not much processing power is warranted, which makes sense and I wish everything did). So if idling, it will clock down and save power/heat/and therefore longevity is increased. I absolutely love this CPU coming from AMD. Anyways...If you have a Corsair H100I RGB Platinum or similar cooler already: The included 1200 screws work just fine with the 1700 socket and this CPU, even though you are supposed to get the 1700 kit/screws for this CPU (Which I did, but they are taking FOREVER to ship, so I googled, and someone said using the 1200 screws will work just fine). I get better temps. than my Ryzen 7 1700. I can even overclock EVEN MORE but have no need, and no point.TL:DRUpgraded from: Ryzen 7 1700, Asus Rog Strix x370-f gaming.Upgraded to: i7-12700K, MSI Z690-A DDR4.Parts kept: 4x8GB 32GB DDR4 CL16 3000MHz RAM (With XMP, D.O.C.P), RTX 2070. The RAM works great with this CPU as well, although it TECHNICALLY (Latency wise, runs at 2T on Intel instead of 1T on AMD) runs slower than when on AMD (AMD's infinity fabric) but obviously whatever Intel is doing makes up for that, and therefore my RAM either runs faster/the same)Pros: It is an amazing CPU for price VS performance. The i5-12600K is good as well (I almost just went with it), and you would be fine going with it for gaming (As even it still has more cores technically than the Ryzen 7 5800X, it also beats the 5800X even though THIS CPU is supposed to be its comparison rival brother.) This CPU has cool temps on my Corsair H100I RGB Platinum cooler, and the P&E core structure are REALLY cool and fun to watch when doing tasks/gaming. It shipped fast!Cons: Literally none with the CPU itself. Just with shipping - It shipped really fast! Was here in 2-3 days after purchasing on here. The biggest complaint I have is Amazon's shipping (SO BE AWARE OF THIS) I have never ordered computer parts from Amazon, and have always used New-egg. They just left the CPU in my mail-box, and if it weren't for me looking at my camera's, and looking out for this part, it would have sat in the mail-box all day. My mail-box sadly is not very weather proof as well, and if it had been raining... It wouldn't have been good. Although it did come in a big box around it. The CPU also was jarred loose and flopping around in the box (Not held into the front window).I hope this review helps people!
